# Project Info Packets.
Welcome, everyone. This is a community effort to help support the mission of Passage, Inc. by coming together as a team and donating your time to help us research and write small readable packets that can inform 
students about various trades and skilled career options. This is completely open source, and the resources are made for educators, students, and communities. We use github as it natively supports markdown technology which is this file. 

We're using Github as it natively supports MD files that can be exported into PDF and Web Pages without supporting multiple formats. Also ensures:
* Version Control - Ensuring we have the latest documents deployed on our website.
* Proper Author Accreditation.
* Security.
* Open Source Culture.

We currently need support in the following roles:
* Community Writers
* Community Manager (1/2)
* Community Graphic Designer
* Editor (1/2)
* Fact Checker (2/4)

Anyone can contribute as a writer or designer. If you'd like to become a community manager, please reach out to ```team@passagenv.com``` with the email subject: "Application (Role Name)."

We're currently working on Standards of Operations and a template. If you'd like to be part of the community for non-change purposes, you can join our Discord/Slack/other network.
